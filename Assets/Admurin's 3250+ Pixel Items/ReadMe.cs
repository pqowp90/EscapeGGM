//Hello!

//First of all, I would like to thank you for purchasing this pack! I am glad that it caught your attention and it was what you were looking for!
//I hope that you like the items that I have made, it took me quite a bit of time but I really enjoyed them. I hope you do so as well!

//If you have any feedback or critique please let me know, this is the only way I can get better as an aspiring artist.
//If you have any suggestions on how to improve the packaging of the asset, reach out to me through email or any other socia media that you prefer. 
//After this I can try to modify them.

//Lastly, it would mean a lot if you could leave a comment about which pack or individual sprite you like the most and if possible a review.

//I promise to read all of them and keep making more pixel art!

//Thank you once again, and I hope that your projects come to life!


//Regards,
//Admurin
